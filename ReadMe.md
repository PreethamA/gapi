Sure, I can help you set up a test Gmail account and enable the APIs for it. Here are the steps:

1. Go to https://console.developers.google.com and sign in with your Google account.
2. Create a new project by clicking on the "Select a project" drop-down menu on the top bar and then click on the "New project" button. Follow the prompts to create the project and give it a name.
3. Once the project is created, go to the project dashboard by clicking on the project name in the drop-down menu on the top bar.
4. Click on the "Enable APIs and Services" button on the dashboard page.
5. Search for "Gmail API" in the search bar and select it. 
6. Click on the "Enable" button to enable the Gmail API for your project. 
7. Next, you will need to create OAuth 2.0 credentials for your project so that it can authenticate and access your Gmail account. To do this, click on the "Create credentials" button and select "OAuth client ID".

9. Click on the "Create" button to create the credentials.
